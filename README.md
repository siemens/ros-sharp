[ROS#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp) is a set of open source software libraries and tools in [C\# ](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/csharp) for communicating with [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) from .[NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net) applications, in particular [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

[Here](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki/Info_Showcases) are some showcases illustrating what can be done with ROS#.
Community provided a variety of other application examples for ROS# [here](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/issues/20). Please don't hesitate to post yours!

## Recent Changes ##

The biggest changes in [ROS# Version 1.5](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/releases/tag/v1.5) are:

*  __[ROS Action](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib) Support:__
Please check out the [FibonacciActionServer](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/blob/master/Unity3D/Assets/RosSharp/Scripts/RosBridgeClient/RosCommuncation/FibonacciActionServer.cs) and [FibonacciActionClient](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/blob/master/Unity3D/Assets/RosSharp/Scripts/RosBridgeClient/RosCommuncation/FibonacciActionClient.cs) example and find the corresponding ROS tutorial [here](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib_tutorials/Tutorials/SimpleActionServer%28ExecuteCallbackMethod%29).

* __Message Class Generation via Unity Editor:__
Please check out the new Unity menu item `RosBridgeClient > Generate Messages > ...`
 [This](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki/Dev_NewMessageTypes) wiki page gives an overview on the different options to generate new message files.

* __BSON (De-)Serialization:__
As alternative to JSON, you can now select to set up BSON communication with `rosbridge_server`.
Make sure to activate `bson_only_mode` when launching `ros_bridge_server` as explained [here](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/pull/198).

Please also check out the [Wiki page](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki/Dev_ROSUnityCoordinateSystemConversion) on Coordinate System Conversions between ROS and Unity.

   [Urdf](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/tree/master/Libraries/UrdfImporter)
  * example scenes and reference code (see [Wiki](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki))

## Releases ##

In addition to the source code, [Releases](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/releases) contain:

  * to be imported in other Unity projects using ROS#.
* binaries of [RosBridgeClient](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/tree/master/Libraries/RosBridgeClient) and [Urdf](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/tree/master/Libraries/Urdf)
  * to be used in other .NET projects using these libraries.

The latest release is also being published in the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/ros-ros-unity-communication-package-107085).

Please get the latest development version directly from the [tip of this master branch](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp).
