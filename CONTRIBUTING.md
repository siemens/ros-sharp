Contributions to [ROS\#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/blob/master/README.md) are always welcome!

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching the **existing issues**.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a **new issue**. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change to the [project team](mailto:martin.bischoff@siemens.com) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue until you have collected positive feedback about the change by the [project team](mailto:martin.bischoff@siemens.com). Issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use [ROS\# ](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/blob/master/README.md) by contacting the [project team](mailto:martin.bischoff@siemens.com).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the ROS\# documentation?**
